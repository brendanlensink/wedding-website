        <h2>The Ceremony</h2>

        <p>
            Our ceremony will be held a short 10 minute drive from the reception venue, at the Lightning Lakes day use area. See a map <a href="./accomodations#venue-map">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The ceremony will be outside, a very short walk from the parking lot in a grassy field so please come prepared.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Please arrive by 1:30pm to ensure you're able to get parked, seated, and comfortable for the ceremony to start at 2pm.

        <h2>Cocktail Hour</h2>

        <p>
            After the ceremony, the bride and groom will sneak away for a couple moments to take some pictures with close family. Please take this time to head back down to the resort, take a nap, have a coffee, put on your dancing shoes, and prepare for a night of celebration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Join us for a cocktail, chat, and visit any time after 4pm in the Alpine Room next to the Manning Park Lodge.

            Please arrive at the reception by 5:30pm to give yourself time to get a drink and find your seat before dinner is served.
        </p>

        <p> 
            After dinner, we'd love for you to stick around and join us for dessert and night of dancing and celebration.
